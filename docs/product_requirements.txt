## Classification Requirements

1. Multi-Dimensional Tagging
   - Each file can belong to multiple categories
   - Hierarchical and nested classification support
   - Flexible and extensible category system

2. Machine Learning Approach
   - Use supervised learning for initial training
   - Implement active learning for continuous improvement
   - Support user-defined custom categories

3. Metadata Extraction
   - Extract relevant metadata for classification
   - Support multiple file types (docx, pdf, txt, etc.)
   - Preserve original file metadata

4. User Interaction
   - Allow manual category override
   - Provide confidence scores for automatic classifications
   - Enable user feedback for model improvement

## Technical Constraints
- Minimal performance overhead
- Low memory footprint
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Support for large file collections

## File Similarity and Versioning Features
1. Similarity Detection Techniques
   - Filename string matching
   - File extension comparison
   - Content-based similarity analysis
     * TF-IDF vectorization
     * Cosine similarity calculation
     * Semantic embedding comparison
   - Configurable similarity thresholds

2. Versioning Strategy
   - Version generation based on:
     * Content completeness
     * Similarity percentage
     * Modification timestamp
     * Unique content hash
   - Automatic version naming
   - Preservation of original file metadata
   - User-configurable versioning rules

3. Conflict Resolution
   - Propose intelligent file renaming
   - Maintain version history
   - Optional manual review

## Future Expansion
