- [ ] Set up project directory structure
- [ ] Initialize version control (Git)
- [ ] Create virtual environment
- [ ] Set up dependency management (requirements.txt)

## 2. Research and Technology Selection
- [ ] Investigate NLP libraries for content analysis
  - Options: spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers
- [ ] Research machine learning classification techniques
- [ ] Explore file system interaction libraries
  - Options: `os`, `pathlib`, `shutil`
- [ ] Evaluate cross-platform compatibility strategies

## 3. Core File Analysis Module
- [ ] Develop file content reading mechanism
  - Support multiple file types (txt, pdf, docx, etc.)
- [ ] Implement content classification algorithm
- [ ] Create content similarity and categorization logic
- [ ] Design file metadata extraction
- [ ] Develop advanced file similarity detection
  - Implement multi-technique similarity scoring
  - Create intelligent versioning mechanism
